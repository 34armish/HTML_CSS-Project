			Java Programming at Wikibooks<br>
			Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
			implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
			programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
			that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode<br>
			that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
			syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
			runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically
			not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming
			languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found] particularly for client server web
			applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<br>

			Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core
			component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers,
			virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
			2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of
			its<br>
			Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine,
			however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used
			by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

			As of March 2023, Java 20 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support
			(LTS) versions.

		<h2>&nbsp;History</h2>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;Development</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
			Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
			television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
			outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java
			coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and
			application programmers would find familiar.<br>

			Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised write once,
			run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and
			featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon
			incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0
			compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language<br>
			specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 - 1999), new
			versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and
			APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized
			for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed
			new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.<br>

			In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to
			formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard,<br>
			controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations
			available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through
			the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

			On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software
			(FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of
			its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion
			of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.<br>

			Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist.
			Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009-10, Oracle has described itself as
			the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and
			transparency. This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for
			using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section).

			On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.<br>

			In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the
			browser plugin.

			Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific
			supercomputers.

			Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to
			unresolved security issues in older versions.

			As of September 2021, Java 8, 11 and 17 are supported as Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.

			Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for
			commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use<br>
			indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 18 and 8, 11 and 17 that are
			still receiving security and other upgrades.

		<h2>&nbsp;JAVA Editions</h2>
		</p>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its 
			APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. 
			The platforms are:<br>

            Java Card for smart-cards.<br>
            *Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) - targeting environments with limited resources.<br>
            *Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) - targeting workstation environments.<br>
            *Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) - targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.<br>
            The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, 
			classes, subpackages and exceptions.

            Sun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile 
			pairings.
