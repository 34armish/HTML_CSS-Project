		<h2>&nbsp;What is PHP?</h2>
		</p>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by
			Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference
			implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home
			Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.<br>

			PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a
			Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP
			code - which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data would form the whole or
			part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks
			exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP
			can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical<br>
			applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command
			line.

			The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License.
			PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and
			platforms.<br>

			The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original
			implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work
			has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.<br>

			W3Techs reports that as of January 2023, "PHP is used by 77.8% of all the websites whose server-side
			programming language we know." It also reports that only 8% of PHP users use the currently supported 8.x
			versions. Most use unsupported PHP 7, more specifically 7.4, and even PHP 5 has 23% of the use, also not
			supported with security updates, and known to have serious security vulnerabilities.

		<h2>&nbsp;History</h2>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;Development</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			PHP development began in 1993 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs
			in C, which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and
			to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or
			PHP/FI.<br>

			PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the
			code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version
			1.0" on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on 8 June 1995. This release
			already had the basic functionality that PHP has today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling,
			and the ability to embed HTML. The syntax resembled that of Perl, but was simpler,[citation needed] more
			limited[citation needed] and less consistent.[citation needed].<br>
			Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language, and grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in
			retrospect: "I don't know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I
			have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the
			way. A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released
			PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.<br>

			The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent
			naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the function names
			were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was "wrapping", while in some very early
			versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were
			chosen to improve the distribution of hash values.

		<h2>&nbsp;PHP Varsions</h2>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;PHP 3 and 4</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the
			language's name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Afterwards, public testing of
			PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite
			of<br>
			PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999.They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan,
			Israel.

			On 22 May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released.By August 2008, this branch had
			reached version 4.4.9. PHP 4 is now no longer under development and nor are any security updates planned to
			be released.
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;PHP 5</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			On 1 July 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by the new Zend Engine II. PHP 5 included new features such
			as improved support for object-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension (which defines a
			lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance enhancements. In
			2008, PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from
			previous versions of PHP, and was added in version 5.3.<br>

			Many high-profile open-source projects ceased to support PHP 4 in new code from February 5, 2008, because of
			the GoPHP5 initiative, provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP 4 to
			PHP 5.

			Over time, PHP interpreters became available on most existing 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, either by
			building them from the PHP source code or by using pre-built binaries. For PHP versions 5.3 and 5.4, the
			only available Microsoft Windows binary distributions were 32-bit IA-32 builds, requiring Windows<br>
			32-bit compatibility mode while using Internet Information Services (IIS) on a 64-bit Windows platform. PHP
			version 5.5 made the 64-bit x86-64 builds available for Microsoft Windows.

			Official security support for PHP 5.6 ended on 31 December 2018.

			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;PHP 6 and Unicode</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking native Unicode support at the core language level. In
			2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by
			embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16
			internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code,
			it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in
			development.<br>

			However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising
			from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project.
			As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP
			6,<br>
			notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP 5.4
			release was prepared to contain most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP 6, such as traits and closure
			re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but by 2014 none
			had been adopted.
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;PHP 7</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			During 2014 and 2015, a new major PHP version was developed, PHP 7. The numbering of this version involved
			some debate among internal developers. While the PHP 6 Unicode experiments had never been released,
			several articles and book titles referenced the PHP 6 names, which might have caused confusion if a new
			release were to reuse the name. After a vote, the name PHP 7 was chosen.<br>

			The foundation of PHP 7 is a PHP branch that was originally dubbed PHP next generation (phpng). It was
			authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui and Nikita Popov, and aimed to optimize PHP performance by
			refactoring the Zend Engine while retaining near-complete language compatibility. By 14 July 2014,<br>
			WordPress-based benchmarks, which served as the main benchmark suite for the phpng project, showed an almost
			100% increase in performance. Changes from phpng make it easier to improve performance in future versions,
			as more compact data structures and other changes are seen as better suited for a successful migration to a
			just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Because of the significant changes, the reworked Zend Engine was called
			Zend Engine 3, succeeding Zend Engine 2 used in PHP 5.<br>

			Because of the major internal changes in phpng, it must receive a new major version number of PHP, rather
			than a minor PHP 5 release, according to PHP's release process. Major versions of PHP are allowed to
			break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an opportunity for other improvements
			beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks. In particular, it involved the following
			changes:<br>

			Many fatal or recoverable-level legacy PHP error mechanisms were replaced with modern object-oriented
			exceptions.
			The syntax for variable dereferencing was reworked to be internally more consistent and complete, allowing
			the use of the operators ->, [], (),{}, and ::, with arbitrary meaningful left-side expressions.
			Support for legacy PHP 4-style constructor methods was deprecated.
			The behavior of the foreach statement was changed to be more predictable.<br>
			Constructors for the few classes built-in to PHP which returned null upon failure were changed to throw an
			exception instead, for consistency.
			Several unmaintained or deprecated server application programming interfaces (SAPIs) and extensions were
			removed from the PHP core, most notably the legacy mysql extension.
			The behavior of the list() operator was changed to remove support for strings.<br>
			An oversight allowing a switch statement to have multiple default clauses was fixed.
			Support for hexadecimal number support in some implicit conversions from strings to number types was
			removed.
			The left-shift and right-shift operators were changed to behave more consistently across platforms.<br>
			Conversions between floating-point numbers and integers were changed (e.g. infinity changed to convert
			to zero) and implemented more consistently across platforms.
			PHP 7 also included new language features. Most notably, it introduced return type declarations for
			functions which complement the existing parameter type declarations, and support for the scalar
			types (integer, float, string, and boolean) in parameter and return type declarations.
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;PHP 8</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			PHP 8 was released on 26 November 2020. PHP 8 is a major version and has breaking changes from previous
			versions.<br>
			New features and notable changes include:<br>

			*Just-in-time compilation<br>
			Just-in-time compilation is supported in PHP 8.<br>

			PHP 8's JIT compiler can provide substantial performance improvements for some use cases, while PHP
			developer Nikita Popov stated that the performance improvements for most websites will be less substantial
			than the upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 7. Substantial improvements are expected more for mathematical-type
			operations than for common web-development use cases. Additionally, the JIT compiler provides the future
			potential to move some code from C to PHP, due to the performance improvements for some use cases.<br>

			*Addition of the match expression<br>
			Main article: PHP syntax and semantics § Match_expression
			PHP 8 introduced the match expression. The match expression is conceptually similar to a switch
			statement and is more compact for some use cases. Because match is an expression, its result can be
			assigned to a variable or returned from a function.<br>

			*Type changes and additions<br>
			PHP 8 introduced union types, a new static return type, and a new mixed type.

			"Attributes", often referred to as "annotations" in other programming languages, were added in PHP 8, which
			allow metadata to be added to classes.<br>

			throw was changed from being a statement to being an expression. This allows exceptions to be thrown in
			places that were not previously possible.<br>

			*Syntax changes and additions<br>
			PHP 8 includes changes to allow alternate, more concise, or more consistent syntaxes in a number of
			scenarios. For example, the nullsafe operator is similar to the null coalescing operator ??, but used when
			calling methods. The following code snippet will not throw an error if getBirthday() returns null:<br>

			*$human_readable_date = $user->getBirthday()?->diffForHumans();<br>
			Constructor property promotion has been added as "syntactic sugar," allowing class properties to be set
			automatically when parameters are passed into a class constructor. This reduces the amount of
			boilerplate code that must be written.<br>

			Other minor changes include support for use of ::class on objects, which serves as an alternative for the
			use of get_class();[ non-capturing catches in try-catch blocks; variable syntax tweaks to resolve
			inconsistencies; support for named arguments; and support for trailing commas in parameter lists, which adds
			consistency with support for trailing commas in other contexts, such as in arrays.<br>

			*Standard library changes and additions<br>
			Weak maps were added in PHP 8. A WeakMap holds references to objects, but these references do not prevent
			such objects from being garbage collected. This can provide performance improvements in scenarios where
			data is being cached; this is of particular relevance for object relational mappings (ORM).
			Various adjustments to interfaces, such as adding support for creating DateTime objects from interfaces, and
			the addition of a Stringable interface that can be used for type hinting.<br>
			Various new functions including str_contains(), str_starts_with(), and str_ends_with();fdiv();
			get_debug_type(); and get_resource_id()
			Object implementation of token_get_all()<br>
			*Additional changes<br>
			Type annotations were also added into PHP's C source code itself to allow internal functions and methods to
			have "complete type information in reflection."
			Inheritance with private methods
			Abstract methods in traits improvements
