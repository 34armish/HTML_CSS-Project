			Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
			written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
			CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

			CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
			fonts.[This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
			specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
			the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
			and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
			and its formatting.
			<br>
			Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
			styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
			screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
			content is accessed on a mobile device.

			The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
			than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
			<br>
			The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
			type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
			validation service for CSS documents.

			In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
			CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.

		<h2>&nbsp;History</h2>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;Development</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.At the time, Lie was working with Tim
			Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time,
			and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS
			Recommendation (CSS1)being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he
			became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.

			Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup
			Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement
			for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore,
			existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a
			document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
			<br>
			As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web
			developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex
			HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,made consistent site
			appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor
			developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could
			therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the
			structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for
			printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.

			Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine
			different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.Of these nine proposals,
			two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style
			Sheet Proposal (SSP). Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with
			Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP
			proposal in the Argo browser.Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the
			'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages
			besides HTML).
			<br>
			Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois
			in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995. Around this time the W3C was already being established and
			took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven<br>
			Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board
			(ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members,
			including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, Netscape Communication<br>
			Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).The
			spec was never finished, and is deprecated. By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and
			the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.<br>

			Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review
			Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by Dan
			Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working group, chaired by
			Chris Lilley of W3C.
			<br>
			The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the
			creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS
			level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.

			In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant
			that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from
			Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.

		<h2>&nbsp;HTML Version Timeline</h2>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;CSS 1</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on 17
			December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers. Among its
			capabilities are support for

			Font properties such as typeface and emphasis
			Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements
			Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
			Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements
			Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
			Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
			The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;CSS 2</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A superset
			of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of
			elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced
			by the CSS 3 speech modules) and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.

			The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;CSS 3</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			"CSS3" redirects here. For other uses, see CSS3 (disambiguation).
			Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several
			separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2,
			preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the
			original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.

			Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.

			Some modules have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately stable. At CR stage,
			implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;CSS 4</h3>
		<p class="p-4 text-justify">
			"CSS4" redirects here. For other uses, see CSS4 (disambiguation).
			Jen Simmons discussing the state of CSS in 2019, as several CSS 4 modules were being advanced
			There is no single, integrated CSS4 specification, because the specification has been split into many
			separate modules which level independently.

			Modules that build on things from CSS Level 2 started at Level 3. Some of them have already reached Level 4
			or are already approaching Level 5. Other modules that define entirely new functionality, such as
			Flexbox, have been designated as Level 1 and some of them are approaching Level 2.
			<br>
			The CSS Working Group sometimes publishes "Snapshots", a collection of whole modules and parts of other
			drafts that are considered stable enough to be implemented by browser developers. So far, five such "best
			current practices" documents have been published as Notes, in 2007, 2010, 2015,2017, and
			2018.

			Since these specification snapshots are primarily intended for developers, there has been a growing demand
			for a similar versioned reference document targeted at authors, which would present the state of
			interoperable implementations as meanwhile documented by sites like Can I Use... and the MDN Web
			Docs. A W3C Community Group has been established in early 2020 in order to discuss and define such a
			resource. The actual kind of versioning is also up to debate, which means that the document once
			produced might not be called "CSS4".
