				<h2 class="text-center">Brief History on Web Development</h2>
				<p class="p-4 text-justify">
					Today, adults and kids both use the internet for small daily tasks.
					The Internet was created to be a visual channel that gained popularity within pop culture later.
					The common public can only understand computer systems and software with a graphic interface.
					It worked in the same way for the internet. Common people discovered the power of the internet with
					a GUI.
					PCs made their places in our homes and offices with the advent of the display screen.
					It then gained more traction with the arrival of word processors, video games, and electronic
					spreadsheets.
					Initially, people weren't interested in investing in the World Wide Web. But then the scene changed
					in the
					early 1990s when the visually-aligned browsers began coming into their own.

					After that, web development and design saw a lot of dramatic change. However, many earliest website
					design
					methods have been used since the early 1990s till today.

				<h2 class="text-center">What Does Web Development Mean?</h2>
				<p class="p-4 text-justify">
					Many people think web development only means making websites. That is not true.
					Though, coding and web markup are a big part of web development in Dubai.
					It also includes website design, website publishing, client-side and server-side scripting, CMS
					creation,
					e-commerce development, and more.
					Furthermore, many people who can develop websites can also design websites.
					On the flip side, fewer people exist who are primarily web designers and can handle web development
					too.

				<h2 class="text-center">Difference Between Website Development and Website Design</h2>
				<p class="p-4 text-justify">
					Web design refers to designing web pages using CSS or HTML.
					A good web design makes a website look visually attractive.

					Then the work of web developers starts. They take those web designs and transform them into live
					websites
					through programming. Additionally, they handle and upgrade a database employing an active website.
					Programmers do different kinds of web content-making stuff. These include creating websites, writing
					codes,
					and upgrading articles. Web Devs who don't know how to code can learn CMS website development.
					Some good CMSs are WordPress, Magento, TYPO3, and so on. With the help of these CMSs, even a
					beginner can
					build and maintain websites with the help of a web-based interface.

				<h2 class="text-center">Birth of the Web: Why and Where?</h2>
				<p class="p-4 text-justify">
					Tim Berners-Lee was an English scientist working in CERN. CERN is the prime focus for over 17,000
					researchers from almost 100 nations.
					The researchers would often use the CERN's official website.
					But they conduct their primary research in student research centers and laboratories in their
					respective
					countries.
					This community of experts needed effective tools to collaborate.
					Thus, the primary aim of the web was to enable automatic data transfer between experts in the field
					of
					sciences all over the world.
					Lee proposed that we can build a robust and user-friendly universal data network by integrating
					cutting-edge
					IT innovations,
					information systems, and hypertext.
